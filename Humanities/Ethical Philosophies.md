Different approaches to [[Ethics|ethical]] dilemmas.

Utilitarianism: Decisions for the greater good (greatest amount of people benefited)
- Looks at return on investment
- Act utilitarianism focuses on the future benefits over present benefits
	- 8 embryos vs. 1 small child

**Rights**: focus on individual rights vs. the greatest good
- sometimes rights are in conflict (right to bear arms vs. right to life)

**Justice**: Respect for law, least total harm, fair and equitable
- Lady justice (blind, balance of scales)
- Ethics of care, an empathetic justice

**Capabilities**: opportunity to achieve wellness
- Wealth gaps -> health gaps
- Therefore, closing the wealth gap improves individual freedoms
- Instead of focusing on rights, we can focus on capabilities
	 -  A right vote isn't really an individual freedom if there's lobbyists and poor education/registration

Virtue: Virtues are not inherent, but are deliberate characteristics practiced and refined over time
- Virtues require energy and time
- Requires practical wisdom (fully imagined consequences of ones actions)
- Contrasts consequentialism (actions and results) and deontology (moral duty). Can be paired with them though
