As a child I didn't have a favorite myth/traditional piece of literature. Currently however, I can say that I like Rumpelstiltskin a good bit. I don't remember when I first heard of Rumpelstiltskin, but it must've been sometime in elementary school. I like how the story is pretty dark, as it's just fairy tale debt collection.
