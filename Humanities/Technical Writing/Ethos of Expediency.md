## Ethical Problem in Rhetoric

- Katz argues that the memo is technically *perfect*, with the author presenting their problem and solution in an easily digestible and well-argued way.
- The memo does use a writing style that is considered "stuffy". Walter Gibson points out that this style of writing contributes to a "group think" of putting all the "blame" on the larger organization, not the writer or reader.
	- Over usage of modified nouns ("natural tendency", "fluid liquid")
	- Passive voice
	- Separation of subject and verb
	
> Ethos of expediency -> Efficiency over all else. Nazi's outside of the founders were good bureaucrats, not psychopaths. 

- **Katz will show in the paper that the** ***ethic of expediency*** **is an issue underlying lots of modern technical writing and is so predominant in Western culture was at least** ***partially responsible*** **for the holocaust**

>[!quote]  Author's Purpose
>In this paper I will attempt to show that what I have called an ethic of expediency underlies technical writing and deliberative rhetoric (see Olsen and Huckin, Principles 70), and that
this ethic, which is so predominant in Western culture, was at least partially re
sponsible for the holocaust.
Thus it will be my contention that the ethical problem represented in Just’s
memo to his superior, while an extreme case, is not an anomaly nor a problem in
technical writing only, but a problem of deliberative rhetoric—defined by Aristotle as that genre of rhetoric concerned with deliberating future courses of action.
I will argue that the ethic of expediency in Western culture which Aristotle first
treated systematically in the Rhetoric, the Nicomachean Ethics, and especially
the Politics, was rhetorically embraced by the Nazi regime and combined with
science and technology to form the “moral basis” of the holocaust. While there
is a concern for ethics in the field of technical communication, and while few in
our society believe expediency is an adequate moral basis for making decisions,
I will suggest that it is the ethic of expediency that enables deliberative rhetoric
and gives impulse to most of our actions in technological capitalism as well, and
I will explore some of the implications and dangers of a rhetoric grounded ex
clusively in an ethic of expediency. In doing so, I hope to mount a critique of the
ethic of expediency that underlies technical communication and deliberative
rhetoric, and by extension writing pedagogy and practice based on it.

### Views on the Holocaust

Should we treat it as a sacred event, one where the silence around it is more important than the event itself? (Wiesel)
Or should we see it as a natural outgrowth of deeper problems underlying Western civilization? (Steiner)

>While I agree with Wiesel’s argument against the
trivialization of the holocaust through popularizations and respect him im
mensely, an exclusively Platonic stance toward the holocaust prevents us from
fully understanding how it happened, and from understanding the relationship it
reveals between rhetoric and ethics.

## Expediency

We need to care about [[Ethics|ethics]] in technical writing because more than any other kind of writing, technical writing is the most influential on the *actions* taken on by people. 

- *Ethos* is the link between deliberation and action
	- While *logos* "considers the means necessary", *pathos* and *ethos* provide the impetus to act
- A purely [[Epistemology|epistemological]] approach to technical writing naturally leads to an ethic of expediency
	- Everything is a technical means to a "higher" end (truth)
	- This lead to form the "moral" basis of Nazi society
		- An *ethos* of an entire culture
- Expediency reduces arguments of worth and goodness to a means to an end, reducing their ethicality
	- Appeals to give charity due to a tax break
- Aristotle's concept and virtue ahs deteriorated due to individualist and utilitarianism.

## Hitler's Ethical Program
Hitler's program was "ethical" in the broadest sense of the term. Hitler knew that to have such a hideous program in action, he must have a spiritual foundation.
> The spiritual base must be motivated by "concern" for the State, or technology itself
- There is no difference between wisdom and virtue, as long as it serves an end (the State)
- Expediency becomes the basis of virtue itself (Hitler)
- Hitler saw to secure the wellbeing of the Aryan race
	- Jews must be killed for the race to prosper, exile/slavery would not suffice
	- Technology (eugenics, racial biology, mechanical improvements) provided a reason for expediency. Best seen with the gassing van memo.
		- Turning an entire nation into a death machine is good, cause it's efficient, and efficiency is good.

Hitler breaks down the separation of expediency of technology and politics masterfully, forming a new "ethical" moral basis to commit mass genocide.

## Nazi Rhetoric
In late industrial capitalism, technological values upend traditional values.
> Value is determined by [[Utility|utility]] over traditional societal values

- Expediency is the only "technical" ethic, the only one with "pure rationality"
	- The only ethic that can be "measured"
	- Hitler was a "religious rationalist"
Expediency can be exclusively grounded in itself, using no other ethic as basis. Common now in our highly scientific, technological era.
