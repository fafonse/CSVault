r= \frac{\sum{\frac{x_{i}-\overline{x}}{s_{x}}} (\frac{y_{i}-\overline{y}}{s_{y}})}{n-1}

| variable | definition |
| -------- | ---------- |
| *r* | correlation coefficient |
| *n* | individuals in a sample
| $\overline{x}$ | sample mean of independent variable
| $s_{x}$ | [[Variability in a Dataset\|standard deviation]] of the independent variable |
| $\overline{y}$ | sample mean of dependent variable
| $s_{y}$ | standard deviation of the dependent variable


- Coefficient has limits. $-1 \le r \le 1$
- If $r=1$, then there is a positive linear relation between variables
- if $r=-1$, then there is a negative linear relation between variables
- As $r\to0$, then there is a weak linear correlation

> For monotonic relations use [[Spearmans Correlation Coefficient]]
