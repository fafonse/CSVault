- A and B independent when adding more information/variables doesn't change the outcome
- P(a ]cap B)
- Mutually exclusive $ independent

- Two events A and B are independent when
	- $Pr(A\cap B) = Pr(A)Pr(B)$
- A set of events $\{A_{i}\}$ is independent in case
	- $Pr(\cap_{i}A_{i}) = \prod_{i} Pr(A_{i})$

> Ex: If you roll two dice, the chance of you landing two sixes is the same as if you rolled each dice separately and got six on both. The dice's outcome is independent from one another.
