> A function of the possibility of certain outcomes.
> Has a range of 0-1, and is continuous. Use to find likeliness of certain outcomes.

 Use **PMF** for discrete variables (digital) and **PDF** for continuous variables (analogue)

- **Cumulative Distribution Functions**: probability of a certain outcome that falls within the cumulative possible answers
	- Starts at 0, and always ends up at 1
	- For a dice roll, your CDF(2) would be 1/6, since on average, you got a 1/6 chance
- **Expected Value**: Average probability of something happening given a fuck ton of attempts
	- $F*F(x)$
	- *What are your chances of getting 2 on a dice roll?*
		- Expected value is 1/6
		- If you roll 3 times, the lowest you get 1/3 times
