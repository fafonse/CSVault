> To calculate data from percentages we break it into quarters and percentiles.

- Percentiles: pth percentile is the value below which p% of data fall
- Quartiles: Q1 = 25th, Q2 = 50th, Q3 = 75th, Q4 = 100th
- Five-number summary: min, Q1, mean, Q2, median, Q3, Max
	- Gives you a good summary of a data set.
