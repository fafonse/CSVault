You just made a plot with all these variables, and now you don't know what you're looking at. It's all random, no correlations or lines you can draw that make it any better. How do you fix this?

1. Segment the data out
	- For continuous variables, try making data ranges and work with those instead. Try using a [[Box Plots|box plot]] or a bar graph to compare the data ranges.
