***Experiment***: toss a coin twice
***Sample space***: possible outcomes of an experiment
***Event***: subset of possible outcomes
***Probability of an Event***: an number assigned to an event
- Represented as $P(C|A)$, where C is the event you want to track, and A is the total events

## Interpretations of Probability
- **Classical**: equally likely outcomes
- **Relative Frequency**: long-run proportion
	- $n_{event}/n_{total events}$
	- ex: A coin lands head every $12/25$ times
- **Subjective***: based on judgement or belief

## Basic Probability Properties
- $0 \le P(A) \le 1$
- $P(A) = 1 - P(A')$
- If $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive: $P(A\cap B) = 0$
- Addition Rule: $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$
- If mutually exclusive: $P(A) + P(B)$

## Conditional Probability
- Definition: $P(A|B) = P(A\cap B)/P(B), P(B)>0$
- Useful: $P(A\cap B) = P(B) P(A|B)$
	- What's the probability of A and B happening?
		- i.e. what are the chances of two heads?
	- Probability of B coming true, and the probability of A being true when you know B is true

## Joint Probability
- For events A and B, ***joint probability*** Pr(A)
