- Mean
	- Arithmetic average, *sensitive to [outliers](Outliers)*
- Median
	- Middle value in ordered data, *robust to outliers*
- Mode
	- Most frequent value in a set

### Examples

- Median latency is more readable than mean latency for server reports
	- Lag spikes could drastically affect the mean, and lag spikes happen randomly all the time
- Finding the *mode* annual income instead of the *average/mean* annual income can be more valuable, as its very robust to outliers, and shows what is the most *common* income.
	- For the USA here's some numbers:
		- *Average Income*: $121,000
		- *Median Income*: $83,730
		- *Mode Income:* $25k - $50k (estimate, census doesn't track this)
			- 20% of Americans fall into this income bracket
