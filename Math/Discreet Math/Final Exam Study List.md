## Combinatorials
fuck that shit twin


## Later stuff
- [[Miller Test]] - be able to do it by hand (memorized)
- [[Relative Primes]] - do it by hand (memorized)
- [[Modular Arithmetic]] - do math with $n$ base (mult / div)
	- Convert between bases too
- [[Inverse Modulus]] - do by hand
- [[Prime Numbers#Finding Prime Factors|Prime factorization]] - do a refresher (ts ez)
- [[Greatest Common Divisors#Euclidean Algorithm|Euclid's Algorithm]] - do by hand (ts ez af)
