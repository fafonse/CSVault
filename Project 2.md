1. Set up [[5 Number Summary]] for each variable
2. Setup a 95% [[Confidence Intervals]] using mean of FEV vs  smoking habit
3. Setup a CI for mean FEV for age groups (5-9/10-14/15-19)
	1. Use [[ANOVA]] and the [[ANOVA#Tukey Method|tukey method]] to find the relations between all the means for the age groups
4. Compare the mean FEV level for age ranges (10-14) and (15-19) between boys and girls. Use CI to find the means and [[Hypothesis Testing]] to compare the means between genders
5. Create a box plot of data for the age ranges, with the $y$ being FEV levels and $x$ being the age. Create a plot for boys and one for girls. Make some conclusions from it.

## Bird Diseases

Two-sampled dependent testing here.

1. Check if Bilsecpt has any change before and after using [[Hypothesis Testing#Two Sample Testing|hypothesis testing]]
2. Compare the secretion differences with that of the SALINE group. You need to create a differences column in the data for the before and after of each group.
