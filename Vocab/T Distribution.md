The standard distribution formula used when testing *samples*, not population. Has a fatter "tail" than a normal distribution, and more uncertainty.
$$
t=\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

Parameters:
- $\overline{x} =$ sample mean
- $\mu=$ hypothesized population mean
- $s=$  sample standard deviation
- $n=$ sample size


> For population standard deviation, use the [[Standard Deviation|regular formula]].
