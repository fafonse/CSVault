Also known as a *MUD*, multiuser dungeons are the ancestors of all MMORPGs. 

With the rise of telnet and bulletin boards, the 1980's brought with it the technology required for real-time multiuser games. The earliest MUDs play a lot like a multiplayer [zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), but as they matured they added wayy more features that games don't even have nowadays. User scripting was pretty common, allowing users to create their own actions, objects, maps, and NPCs.
