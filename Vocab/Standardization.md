When comparing two distributions, you have to standardize them to the same scale.

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$
Subtract the mean ($\mu$) from the normal values, and divide by the standard deviation ($\sigma$).

The standardized data will have a mean very close to zero and a standard deviation very close to one. This allows you to compare the data even if it don't fit right.
