When a class uses another class as a foundation for itself.

The child class can use all of the methods/attributes of the parent class, but it can expand on them in a more specialized manner.

> [!example] Gaming
> Entity() $\rightarrow$ PlayerChar(), BombEnemy(), TurtleEnemy()
> *parent*-------------*child*
