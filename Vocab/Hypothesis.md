What you're trying to prove/test when doing an experiment/problem.
A good hypothesis has two parts: the null and alternate hypothesis.

*Null Hypothesis* ($H_{0}$) - What you're trying to prove. Average ass hypothesis.
*Alternate Hypothesis* ($H_{1}$) - Opposite of your ultimate hypothesis. If your testing shows your ultimate hypothesis is false, then your null must be true.

### Example
You're trying to prove that Coke is better than Pepsi.

$H_{1}$: Coke at best just as good as Pepsi.
$H_{0}$: Coke is better than Pepsi.
