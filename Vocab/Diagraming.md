Making visual representations of your systems and processes. Use [this site](https://draw.io), its good for professional work. Most of your diagrams are made using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) and more recently [C4](https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/07/spotify-system-model-c4/).

Diagramming helps you understand and ask good questions about your systems and how they work. Visualizing your work flow also makes it easier to collaborate, so that EVERYONE involved understands the process.


## Types of Diagrams

### Component Diagram

- Show the system/tool and the technology used (language or framework)
- We show communication between systems with arrows showing protocols
	- Start the arrow from the "caller" of the protocol
- Similar to a flow diagram, but instead of showing possible decisions, it shows how components communicate with each other
### Flow Charts

- Show each major decision and branch that a user/agent must go through
- Very general overview of the system, we can use a flow chart to construct a *component* diagram
- Helps understand the software from the user perspective, and gives developers an overview of the complete product ahead of time.
