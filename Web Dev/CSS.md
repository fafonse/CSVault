Super powerful tool to create nice looking websites with little overhead.

- Styles can be done inline in HTML, but is very much not normal.
- Instead styles are dictated in a seperate CSS file or in a `<style>` tag.
	- Link your CSS at the top of your HTML
- Styles are applied top to bottom, just like code
- Tags have an increased priority over element styles
- Can include images to add to the background n shit
