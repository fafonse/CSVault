**Added Value:**
- Keeps project predictable
- Reduces stress on the engineers
- Makes sure you're building the right thing

**Software process DO NOT...**
- Guarantee project success
- Ensure market success
- Make things go faster

## Considerations
When choosing a software process, there a couple variables one should consider.
1. *Project Timeline* - Is the schedule aggressive (almost always) or loosely defined?
2. *Developer expertise* - Are they new (need more process) or seasoned (less stringent)?
3. How *disciplined* is the team?
	- Some processes require serious discipline to work
4. The level of *risk or complexity* of the solution.
	- Complex or risky solutions require a more rigid process
5. The level of *understanding of the market* and the specific requirements of the solution

**No matter the process, there are two primary factors in project success:**
1. Someone who understands and can communicate the requirements
2. Smart people who can build the solution according to the requirements
