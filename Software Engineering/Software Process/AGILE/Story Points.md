A way of tracking progress throughout a project with [[User Stories|user stories]].

You give user stories a certain amount of *story points* that are correlated to the amount of time you *assume* the task will take.

A burn down chart tracks your progress over time.

Just calculate the **total story points** from all your user stories and graph how many you **complete in total**. It's also a good idea to compare it to a linear *ideal* rate.
