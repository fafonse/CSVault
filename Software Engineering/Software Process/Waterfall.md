A [[Software Process|software process]] that has very rigid development stages. Called waterfall because all the different development phases flow into each other, creating a "waterfall" effect.

### Example
You and your team start on the idea phase, and when you're done you sign off a design document together. You don't ever change the design (unless starting over), and just do each phase very rigidly.
