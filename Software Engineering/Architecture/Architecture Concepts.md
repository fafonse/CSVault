Good Cohesion
- Only put things into your functions and classes that belong there. No side-effects.
- Don't make your program a Swiss army knife
Loose Coupling
- Make sure that you don't need to know the implementation details of things you're interacting with
- Build interfaces between elements, saves time in the future
- HTTP is a good example of this
Re-use
- Design components so that you could use them for other things, besides what you're building right now
- Make your functions as generic as possible
- Using OOP, keep your classes as general as possible
Modularization
- Break things into manageable chunks
- Similar to loose coupling
Separation of Concerns
- Group activities by their context
- Combine with modularization
