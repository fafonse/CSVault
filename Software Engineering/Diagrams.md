A visual representation of your systems and processes. A useful tool for working in teams. 
>An important, yet commonly overlooked part of the [[Software Process|software process]].

Diagrams are split into two major types: *flow* and *component*

- Good *flow diagrams* have a single flow and represent single function
- Good *component diagrams* show components with technology and interactions with protocol

## Component Diagrams
Should represent components and interactions. Useful to include some implementation details (technologies used, etc).
- Annotate the connections with the API's/communication type used
- No bidirectional arrows
	- Caller points to callee
- **NOT a flow diagram**

## Flow Diagrams
Useful for showing how an object/user changes it's state according to different events.
- User flows
- Data processing
- Agent flows
## Sequence

A diagram that shows a linear sequence of events (not a flow chart). Rather it shows how multiple systems may interact during an event with each other.x
