The servers that attach an IP address to a URL. When using multiple DNS servers, they simply pass along the "address" of the server that contains the requested URL's IP address.

You can make your own local DNS system, as the network works like [[Internet Protocol|IP]], with servers passing work down to each other as it gets more global. A DNS server in Utah will easily link Utahns to the University of Utah website, but if they request a farther URL (yahoo.jp) they need to send the work off to *root* servers.

Root servers are the global DNS servers that are the most authoritative URL tables.
