The medium the data is sent through (wires, pigeons, radio, etc.)

## Physical Media
- Guided vs. Unguided media
	- Do connections must be made physically (wires) or can they just flow out into the world (radio)?

### Guided Media
**Twisted Pair (TP)**
- Originally phone wires, they're useful for digital stuff too
- Two insulated copper wires, two categories
	- CAT5: 100Mb/s, 1Gb/s
	- CAT6: 10Gb/s
- Susceptible to noise

**Coaxial Cable**
- Originally used to run cable TV
- Two concentric copper conductors
- Bidirectional
- Broadband:
	- [[Frequency Division Multiplexing|Multiple frequency channels]] on cable
	- 100's Mb/s per channel

**Fiber Optic Cable**:
- Glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse is a bit
- High-speed operation:
	- 10's to 100's of Gb/s
- Low error rate:
	- Repeaters spaced far apart
	- Immune to EF noise
- Expensive endpoints/receivers

### Unguided Media
Usually done over wireless radio frequencies.
- Signals carried over different "bands" on the EM spectrum
- No physical wire
- Sender to receiver

Notoriously a bitch:
- Signal reflection
- Eavesdropping
- Interference
- Noise
- Attenuation

**Radio link types:**
- WLAN (WiFi)
	- 10-100's Mb/s; 10's of meters
- Wide Area (Cellular)
	- 10's Mb/s over ~10 Km
- Bluetooth (Replacement for short wires)
	- Short distances, limited rates
- Terrestrial Microwave
	- Point-to-point, 45 Mb/s per channel
- Satellite
	- Up to 45Mb/s per channel
	- 270ms end-end delay :(
