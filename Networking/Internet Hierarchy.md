Given millions of access ISPs, how do we get them all connected to each other?

[[Access Network]] -> Regional ISP -> Global ISP (Tier 1)

Instead of having every AN connect to every other AN, we have instead global ISP networks that link to local ISPs. Sometimes we even have *regional* ISPs which group regions to connect to a global ISP.
And since global ISPs can compete with each other, there are *exchange* ISPs (IXP). Those connect separate global ISPs to each other.
