A network that connects the end systems into the larger global internet. This is different from a [[Core Network|core network]], you can think of this as the local network where you can do LAN activities.
## Types
- Residential access networks
- Institutional access networks
	- Schools, companies
- Mobile access networks
	- WiFi, 4G/5G
### Home Networks
Home networks are a variety box of electronics, with both lots of wired and wireless devices all hooked up.
Oftentimes your router, firewall, NAT, and modem are all combined into a single box.

### Enterprise Networks
Think of a home network on steroids.
- Companies, universities, etc.
- Mixed of wired + wireless technologies
- Lots of switches and routers
- Ethernet: 100Mb/s, 1Gb/s, 10Gb/s
- WiFi: 11, 54, 450 Mb/s

>If you want really crazy networks, there's always *data center networks*. They have 10s to 100s of Gb/s bandwidth links, connecting hundreds to thousands of servers together.
## Technology Types

### Cable-based Access
- Multiple residential homes can be linked up on the same TV cable network
	- Uses [[Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]] to allow multiple data streams on a single cable
		- This has the disadvantage of increased traffic leading to lower speeds
- Optimized for asymmetric data usage
	- More download, less upload
	- 40 Mb/s - 1.2 Gb/s download
	- 30-100 Mb/s upload rate

### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
	- Also known as a *twisted-pair*, which may still carry phone service to your home
- Not sharing bandwidth with your neighbors
- Asymmetric data usage
	- 24-52 Mb/s download rate
	- 3.5-16 Mb/s download rate
- Has a distance limit for how far you can lay out the telephone cable

### Wireless Access Networks

Can be split into 2 types:
- Wireless [[LAN|local area networks]] (WLAN)
	- Typically within or around a building (~100ft)
	- 802.11b/g/n (WiFi): 11, 54, 450 Mb/s transmission rate
		- Highly standardized
- Wide area cellular based networks (cellular)
	- Provided by mobile, cellular network operator (10's of km)
	- 10's Mb/s
	- 4G/5G cellular networks
