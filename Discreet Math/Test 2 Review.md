1. Answer is 5
2. Don't think of numbers, think of the amount they represent.
   Answer is *1012*
3. Like standard base 10 long multiplication.
	- Answer is *2000122*
4. Answer is *(5, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3)*
5. Just remember what symbolic representation means. Just follow the steps [[Modular Arithmetic#Converting to Base10|here]].
	   Answer is *65*
6. Follow the steps [[Modular Arithmetic#Converting from Base10|here]]
	   Answer is *21102*
7. Inverse modulus is a bitch. Check [[Inverse Modulus#Euclidian's Theorem|ts]] out, it uses the same example from the practice test.
	   Answer is *37*
8. RSA is where we use [[Relatively Prime|relative primes]]. 
9. Do what you did normally, taking out the primes from the factorial and making the composite numbers their prime bases.
	   Answer is $2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7$
10. Just remember the method from [[Greatest Common Divisors#Euclidean Algorithm|euclidian's algorithm]].
	    Answer is *21*
11. All the prime numbers (or odd numbers if your lazy) up to the square root of $n$.
		Answer is *B*
