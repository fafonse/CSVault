> Given $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 15$, how many combinations are there?


## Condition Types

### At least


### Exact match

### At most

A bit more complicated.

1. Find the at least and exact match conditions that are the "inverse" of the at most condition.
2. Count the number of combinations that both have, and add them up
3. Subtract that number from the number of unrestrained possibilities
4. Boom, you got your At Most figure
