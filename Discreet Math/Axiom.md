Something is unproven, but is held to be true.

First we have [[Postulate|postulate]], which we can then prove to add to our *circle of truth*, which basically all of our known axioms.
## Odd Numbers

If $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k + 1$.
If $n$ is even, then $n= 2k$

### Proofs
> Given an odd $n$, $n^2$ is also odd
> $n = 2k + 1$
> $n^2 = (2k + 1)^2$
> $n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$
> $n^2 = 2(k^2 + 2k) + 1$
> 
> $n^2$ is odd then.

## [[Rational Numbers]]


> Given $p$ and $q$ as rational integers, then $p + q$ is also rational
> $p = \frac{q}{b}$
> $q = \frac{c}{d}$
> $p + q = \frac{q}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{qd}{bd} + \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{qd + bc}{bd}$
> Therefore, $p + q$ is also rational

> $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational
> First we assume $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number
> $\sqrt{2} = \frac{q}{b}$
> $2 = \frac{q^2}{b^2}$
> $2b^2 = q^2$
> Because as is even, 
> $a = 2c)$
> $2b^2 = (2c)^2$
> $2b^2 = 4c$
>$b^2 = 2c$ 

> $a=b$ given
> $qq
