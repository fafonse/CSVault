A method in which we can prove a [[Postulate|postulate]], adding it to our list of [[Axiom|axioms]].

There are several types of proofs:
- **Simple**
	- A set of steps to always get a certain outcome
	- Think geometric proofs
- **Non-constructive**
	- You don't build out any steps
	- "Given X Y Z, we can say that postulate A is true"
	- You don't know the answer, but instead prove there must be one out there
