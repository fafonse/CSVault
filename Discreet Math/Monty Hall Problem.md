> Lets say you're a game show contestant, and you have a prize behind one of 3 doors. However, the other 2 doors just have a gross goat. After picking a door, the host opens an unpicked door and reveals a goat. You have a single chance to change your choice, do you do so?

The correct answer is to repick! Why?
1. When you originally picked, your chance of winning is 1/3
2. When picking again, your chance goes to a 2/3 chance (higher)
	- When you select your choice, there's a 1/3 chance of the prize being behind your door, and a 2/3 chance of it being behind the other doors
