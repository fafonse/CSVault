## Symbols
Propositions work off *statements*. Statements are not questions, but must be either true or false.

$\cap$ - AND
$\cup$ - OR
! - NOT
$a \rightarrow b$ - If $a$, then $b$.
	If "frogs are gay" then "we are in a crisis"
Given $M \rightarrow D$, what's the result?


| M   | D   | $M\rightarrow D$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- |
| F   | F   | T                |
| F   | T   | T                |
| T   | F   | F                |
| T   | T   | T                |

$M\rightarrow D$ is always true no matter what, but when M is true and D is false, then the proposition is false.

## Nots
Given $p\rightarrow q$, you can write it as $!(p\cap !q)$
