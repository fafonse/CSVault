When merging changes from one branch to another, you first create a [[Pull Requests|pull request]], then go through and check for conflicts. If you're all good, you can go ahead and merge the branches. 


> [!warning]
> - Make sure that you are comparing to the `main` branch, and not whatever starter/non-editable branch you started with.
> - Pull after merging to make sure you're up to date
> - Always review pull requests for any conflicts or for code quality
> - Requires you to [[Git Branching|create a new branch]] off your origin
