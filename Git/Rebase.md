Yes Rebase:
When all the conflicts are finished, there's no history of a conflict/divergence. You warp the history so that everything looks clean and dandy. Also makes the logs easier to read.

However, when you want to know when there was a divergence, you can instead no-rebase.
That way even if the logs are hard to read, you can see all the divergences.
